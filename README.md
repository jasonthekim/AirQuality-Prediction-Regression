# AirQuality-Prediction-Regression

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting PM2.5 concentrations across the U.S. using various regression models. The goal is to assess model performance and identify the best predictor variables for accurate forecasting.

## Key Features
- **Model Development:** Built and compared four regression models—Linear Regression, Poisson Regression, Random Forest, and MARS—to predict PM2.5 levels.
- **Feature Selection:** Used correlation analysis and PCA to identify key predictors such as CMAQ and imp_a5000 for optimal model performance.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Implemented 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate model accuracy, with Linear Regression achieving the lowest RMSE and demonstrating the best predictive capability.
